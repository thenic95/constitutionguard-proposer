How to Request Funding from the Cardano Treasury Under the New Constitution
As Cardano is operating under a new Constitution since January 24, many requirements have evolved compared to version v1. It is worthwhile to explore exactly which new requirements now apply to governance actions. If you want to read more about the general changes of the new Constitution, I can recommend another article of mine and a well-written piece from @ArmyofSpies 
For this article, I want to focus on the new requirements for the Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action Type and the specific information proposers must provide in the metadata to comply with the Cardano Constitution.
1. General Requirements for All Governance Actions
The baseline requirements for all governance actions are set out in Article II, Section 6. To ensure transparency and legitimacy, every action must adhere to the following:
Standardized Format & Context: Actions must follow a standardized, legible format . This includes a URL hosting a document outlining additional context, along with the hash of that document . 
Why this matters: The hash ensures integrity. Any change in the metadata file compared to the version used to derive the hash would immediately be exposed.
Immutability: The document hosted by the URL must be immutable and incapable of being altered after submission .
Implication: While the Constitution specifies the property of immutability rather than a specific technology, this effectively enforces the use of immutable, content-addressable storage (like IPFS). This prevents the proposal’s abstract, rationale, or budget from being altered or removed during voting, safeguarding against "link rot" and preserving historical context.
On-Chain Consistency: The content of every on-chain Governance Action must be identical to the final off-chain version of the proposed action .
Example: You cannot have metadata describing a 1,000,000 ada withdrawal if the actual on-chain parameters trigger a withdrawal of 1,000,001 ada.        
Sufficient Rationale: Each proposal must provide a rationale that includes, at a minimum: Title, Abstract, Justification and Relevant supporting materials.
2. Specific Requirements for Treasury Withdrawals
When it comes to Treasury Withdrawal Governance Actions, Article II, Section 7 mandates several additional layers of accountability:
Terms of the Withdrawal: The proposal must clearly specify the terms, including :
1. The purpose of the withdrawal.      
2. The delivery period for the proposed activities.        
3. The relevant costs and expenses.        
4. Circumstances under which the withdrawal might be refunded to the Cardano Treasury.
Prior Funding Disclosure: The prospective recipient must disclose whether they have received ada from the Cardano Treasury within the last 24 months .
Best Practice: I recommend disclosing exact amounts, even if the funding came via a third party (e.g., via Catalyst or a Builder DAO).
Net Change Limit: The requested amount must not exceed the Net Change Limit applicable for that period .
Audit Allocation: The request must include an allocation of ada to cover the costs of periodic independent audits and the implementation of oversight metrics regarding the use of the funds .
Administrator Designation: The action must designate one or more administrators responsible for monitoring how funds are used and ensuring deliverables are achieved .
Fund Segregation & Voting Restrictions: If an administrator holds the ada prior to disbursement, two critical rules apply:
1. The funds must be kept in separate accounts that can be audited by the Cardano Community.
2. These accounts must not be delegated to a Stake Pool Operator (SPO) and must be delegated to the predefined abstain voting option.

Why this matters: This ensures administrators do not benefit financially from staking rewards on funds meant for someone else, nor do they gain undue political influence through increased voting power.
3. Applicable Guardrails
Finally, let us look at the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails (Appendix I). For all treasury withdrawals, guardrails TREASURY-01a through TREASURY-03a apply:
TREASURY-01a: A Net Change Limit for the Treasury balance must be agreed upon by DReps via an on-chain governance action with a threshold of greater than 50% of the active voting stake .
TREASURY-02a: Withdrawals must not exceed the Net Change Limit for that period .
TREASURY-03a: All withdrawals from the Cardano Treasury must be denominated in ada .
